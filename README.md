Here lies my Human User Guide
üëã Introductions!
Howdy! My handle is Caitedid, real name is Caite Palmer, pronouns are she/her/y'all. I'm in far northeastern Iowa, the part the glaciers missed, so we have lots of hills and trees. I'm in the Central timezone, or UTC - 5.

I farm sheep and cattle with my husband Jim, and we have two amazing little baby monkeybutts. Charlotte is almost eight, and Henry is six and a half. We also have two big dogs, +/- 5 cats, and three guinea pigs in the house, plus chickens and ducks outside.

My hobbies include: cohosting a farm parenting podcast Barnyard Language, reading, crocheting and knitting, and being an avid bat enthusiast. I'm also a member of the leadership team for the Neurocats Community of Belonging.

‚òéÔ∏è :letter: Communication Style
:desk: Working Style
I find that I'm generally much more productive if I start early in the morning (5 am-ish), so that I can build some momentum before my kids are up and Slack is exploding and all. Also, I don't expect anyone else to respond outside of their normal working hours. I'm trying to be sure I schedule messages if I can, so that they don't tempt folks. If I really need to get heads down I try to communicate that in my Slack status.

I very much appreciate being able to 'rubber duck' with people, as I often find solutions myself as I'm trying to clearly communicate the problem. I generally try to make sure that people know I'm not really expecting an answer from them, and certainly not in a timely fashion.

For making decisions I generally like to spread all of the options (even the impractical ones) I can come up with out in my head/on a sheet of paper/on a huge whiteboard, then use data, team feedback, and intuition to take things out of the running until we're down to something useful.

:weight: Strengths and Weaknesses
My life and work are both improved and occasionally hindered by my neurodivergence, which I became aware of and had diagnosed since I started working at GitHub. Gaining clarity on the fact that I'm AuDHD and my brain legitimately works differently has been an absolute life-changer, as I had always thought and been told that I was just not very good at human-ing. Getting to work with such accepting and supportive folks, and joining (and now helping lead) the Neurocats has been amazing for my understanding of myself as a member of a normal, but different, set of people.

One of my biggest goals is to improve how I communicate my thought processes to others, especially at work. I've heard it described that neurotypical thoughts are like birds, where neurodivergent thoughts are like dolphins. When you watch a bird you can see where it starts, you can see where it stops, and you can see how it got there. When you watch a dolphin you might see where it starts, you might see where it stops, but it might be upside down, swimming backwards, messing with other stuff, or wobbling around and squeaking in between. This often looks like non-sequiters, leaps of thoughts, and sometimes innovation, but my brain may have hit a lot of points in between and I may not be able to trace back my route.

I am also learning that my brain functions almost entirely in metaphors, comparisons, and sensory data, and I also experience synesthesia (experiencing sensory input with seemingly unrelated words/numbers/sounds). For example, I can iterate on things, walk myself through someone else's experience, look for patterns, improve the logic and specificity in a question, and such quite happily, because all of those involve comparing one thing to another. I struggle a lot more with doing things from 'scratch', unless I have a very clear concept of what I want. I do better creating something new with physical items than I do with non-tangible things like code. I do much better with things like writing queries if I have chunks I can fit together and tweak, rather than having to start new every time.

üîà Feedback Preferences
For starters, if a mystery 1:1 pops up with pretty much anyone, I will be under my desk dealing with my anxiety.

OTOH, I actually LOVE getting feedback, good or bad. This job often feels like we're just trucking along, and other than scheduled reviews it can be really hard to be sure if you're doing a good job and where you can improve. If it's feedback that actually needs action taken, I deeply appreciate getting it in writing, and then being able to discuss it 1:1. I can have a hard time formulating my thoughts on the fly, especially when I'm taking in new information.

Personal Insights
I'm legitimately motivated by pictures of animals, being asked for my thoughts on problems, games/puzzles/snacks, and @khanmj 's masterful use of GIFs.

My signs of stress are usually seeming more distracted than usual, inability to come up with the right words to express myself (stress induced aphasia), and avoiding being on camera at non-essential meetings.

I shut off almost all notifications whenever I can, so my work/life boundary is basically "can you get ahold of me". I tend to check in pretty frequently, and more when I'm FR, but leaving notifications on for too many things is a quick route to massive distraction!
